This is the code of the hemorrhage detection assistant, a project developed by a team of 4 in only 2 weeks during Le Wagon's Data Science Bootcamp.
I was responsible for the preprocessing and constructing the convolutional neural network. We managed to achieve a 85% accuracy to correctly identify hemorrhages in CT scans.
